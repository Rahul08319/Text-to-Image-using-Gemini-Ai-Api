### ✅ Deployment
- **Live Website**: Publicly accessible at the provided URL
- **Demo Mode**: Currently running in demo mode (shows placeholder images)
- **Production Ready**: Full codebase ready for deployment with real API keys

## 🔧 Local Setup for Real Image Generation

To run the application locally with actual Gemini AI image generation:

### 1. Get Your Gemini API Key
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create or import a Google Cloud project
4. Generate an API key from the Dashboard

### 2. Set Environment Variable
```bash
# Linux/macOS
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"

# Windows
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run Locally
```bash
cd gemini-image-generator/backend
source venv/bin/activate
python src/main.py
```

### 4. Replace Demo Route
Update `backend/src/main.py` to use the real Gemini integration:
```python
# Change this line:
from src.routes.image_demo import image_bp

# To this:
from src.routes.image_generation_simple import image_bp
```

## 🌟 Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Full-Stack Development**: React frontend + Flask backend
2. **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for image generation
3. **Modern UI/UX**: Professional design with smooth interactions
4. **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling
5. **Deployment**: Cloud deployment with public accessibility
6. **Security**: Environment variable configuration for API keys

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Get API Key**: Obtain your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
2. **Run Locally**: Follow the local setup guide for real image generation
3. **Customize**: Modify prompts, styling, or add new features
4. **Deploy with API**: Deploy to a service that supports environment variables

## 💡 Usage Tips

### Effective Prompts
- Be specific about style, colors, and composition
- Include artistic styles (e.g., "digital art", "oil painting", "photorealistic")
- Mention lighting and mood for better results
- Add details about perspective and framing

### Example Prompts
- "A majestic dragon soaring through a sunset sky over ancient mountains, digital art style with vibrant colors"
- "A cozy coffee shop in Paris during autumn, warm lighting, people reading books, impressionist painting style"
- "A futuristic cityscape at night with neon lights reflecting on wet streets, cyberpunk aesthetic"

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- The backend protects your API key from client-side exposure
- Consider rate limiting for production deployments
